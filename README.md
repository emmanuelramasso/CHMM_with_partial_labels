This is the implementation of [1], that is a partially hidden Markov model (P-HMM). 
Partially hidden, partially supervised, weakly hidden, weakly supervised, weak prior, soft labels, noisy labels, uncertain and imprecise labels, etc focus on taking account of a prior on the latent space, here for an HMM. 

The code provided allows to reproduce the results of the paper (see figures below).

## Getting Started

`addpath utils/` and run 
1. `example_1_simple.m`: to run a simple example.
2. `example_2_figuresPaper.m`: to reproduce the figures.
